# Face-Recognition

How facial recognition works
Facial recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face. It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person's facial details.
The face detection process is an essential step as it detects and locates human faces in images and videos.
 The face capture process transforms analog information (a face) into a set of digital information (data) based on the person's facial features.
The face match process verifies if two faces belong to the same person.
Today it's considered to be the most natural of all biometric measurements. 

And for a good reason â€“ we recognize ourselves not by looking at our fingerprints or irises, for example, but by looking at our faces.
